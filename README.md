## Introduction
EOS Costa Rica is an initiative of Sistemas Edenia Internacional S.A. (EDENIA), a Costa Rican IT company founded in 1987 as the country’s first BBS service. As the online world progressed towards the internet, the Costa Rican state-owned telecom, ICE, began to provide the country with internet access via its sole ISP Radiografica Costarricense (RACSA). We have since developed a long partnership with Costa Rica’s largest ISP. The company maintains lease contracts of data center space on the 3rd floor of RACSA’s main building in San José with our administrative offices located only 2 blocks from the data center. With decades of experience managing our own server farm, as Costa Rica Servers , we have evolved to serve top tier clients in over 35 countries. After studying and investing early in Dan Larimer’s projects BitShares and Steem, we were convinced to serve the EOS community by offering our hard work, knowledge and resources from Costa Rica to the world.

## Mission
We challenge ourselves to provide the EOS platform with a strong geographical and political diversity by running the most robust EOS Block Producer possible from Costa Rica. We pledge to leverage our talent, experience, and sustainable internet resources to meet such an important challenge.

## Our Values
Education: Our philosophy has always been that knowledge and learning is key to what we do. Continuous training and building our human talent is the reason why we are the most competitive alternative for data center services in Costa Rica.

- **Loyalty:** We are truly a global company serving the world from Costa Rica. We believe that our unique local relationships and reputation exponentially increase the viability of the EOS network. We recognize everyone's unique talents and seek to build loyalty by empowering our workforce

- **Resilience:** We are constantly in motion and have a proven history of evolving as technology improves. We value being nimble and efficient with our resources which allows us to quickly adopt and drive new innovations.

- **Liberty:** We firmly believe that our history in Costa Rica, the longest lasting free democracy in Central America, shapes our philosophy of life, liberty and property.

- **Tolerance:** We work towards the flourishing of our community allowing all its members the right to Education, Entrepreneurship and Opportunity.

- **Prudence:** We are committed to safeguarding the future of our community and put that above short term interests.

- **Deep Sense of Responsibility:** We firmly believe in taking full responsibility for the consequences of our actions and encourage accountability from our stakeholders.

- **Equality:** We will work for and defend a governance model where benefits are distributed according to merit regardless of race, gender, religion or political ideology and for the overall benefit of our community.

## Our Pledge to the EOS Network
EOS Costa Rica pledges to:

Provide the highest-standard network infrastructure possible to the EOS ecosystem.
Be self-funded and secure the investment needed to ensure a competitive EOS Block Producer.
Allocate block rewards to EOS educational and development initiatives.
Sponsor projects and dApps for community-led projects and developers.
Be transparent and open on the allocation of block rewards.
Actively participate in the governance of the blockchain with an open and positive attitude.
Respect and defend the constitution, fair elections, community vigilance and arbitration mechanisms
Our Stable Political Environment, our Geographical Location, and our Access to Clean Energy are our unique contributions to the EOS network.

## Network Redundancy
Fiber optic connections reach Costa Rica on both Pacific and Caribbean coasts via three submarine cables that provide the majority of bandwidth to Costa Rica. Access to all three backbones, ARCOS-1, MAYA-1, and Pan American Crossing (PAC) provides real time failover and redundancy at our facility. Additionally all 6 Central American nations are interconnected via a terrestrial fiber optic network (REDCA). Direct connections to all upstream carriers (Columbus Networks, Sprint, Level 3 Communications and XO Communications) insure that no single point of failure is present in the network. The network employs BGP to assure all traffic reaches its destination if one connection fails. Communication to international connections is made fully redundant and supported in two locations, our main building in San Jose and the Teleport in Calle Blancos, approximately 7 kms away. The EOS network will benefit from this infrastructure, which includes private peering network connections to major Internet carriers. These private peering arrangements allow the network to quickly and efficiently exchange packets of data with every major backbone carrier in a one-to-one environment.

Additionally, the CRIX network connects most of Costa Rica’s Data Centers with fiber optic cable. We will leverage this infrastructure to further decentralize our EOS cluster platform among several different data center locations across Costa Rica.

## Political Environment
Costa Rica has excellent infrastructure, a stable political framework, a flexible corporate structure coupled with a clear legal jurisdiction that we believe are perfect for the censorship-resistant network features of the EOS network.

Costa Rica stands for peace and liberty, characteristics that are internationally recognized and the cornerstones of the country.

## Community Reinvestment
Costa Rica is committed to investing where it matters most with a public education policy that is free and mandatory since 1870. Costa Rica stands out for its high educational standards and outstanding productivity levels and we intend to replicate those values for the local EOS community. We have reached out to the communities in Panama and Guatemala in order to combine efforts and build the most significant EOS cluster in Central America.

</div>

We pledge to reinvest our block rewards following the same formula that has made our country a ideal business environment -- invest in a educational system for EOS developers, fund EOS startups that focus on innovation and partner with local Universities to increase research and development in the EOS ecosystem.

### 7) - Block Producer Candidate Roadmap on Values, Community Project Timeline, Finances, Transparency.
We reiterate our values available at the beginning of this post that will drive our decision making around financing, transparency and community projects. We are already active in communicating with the community by way of your steemit blog (@eos-costarica) and our twitter handle (@eoscostarica) providing updates and encouraging discourse before funds are allocated and distributed.

We also intend to hold block rewards in escrow until the community has demonstrated their support for proposals on our social media outlets. Our goal is to work towards the successful governance of the blockchain and be held accountable by holders, developers and the community in general.

### 8) Position on Dividends
We will reinvest 100% of the block reward back into the EOS network, adding value not just for us as block producers , but for the EOS network in the Central American region. Our goal is to attain this healthy balance between internal investment and external investment in the EOS ecosystem. It is important to cover our operating costs , attract and retain the best talent , and maintain a reserve buffer to face any price volatility.

We will disclose the projected and actual percentages of funds allocated to the following expense categories:

- Inward Facing Activities
- Server Hardware
- Connectivity Infrastructure
- Security (physical and virtual)
- Staff training (technical and non technical skills)
- Staff Compensation
- Office Rental (for engineering/management teams, and community co-working space and classroom)
- Reserve Buffer
- Outbound Activities
